# TicTacToe
Classical TicTacToe game ([Game rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)). This is a pet project in GUI development area. Computer always starts the game with a red cross in the middle of a field. After the game a pop up window with a result appears to the player. Player plays with a green noughts. There is no AI or algorithms integration. It means that computer randomly picks in his turn a free place on the field.
